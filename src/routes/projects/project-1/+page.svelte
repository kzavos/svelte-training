		Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. I'm excited to share this space with you as I
		embark on a journey to learn and master Svelte.<br />
		This website serves as a playground for me to experiment with Svelte, a modern front-end framework
		known for its reactivity and performance.<br />
		As I follow tutorials and work through various projects, I'll be documenting my progress and sharing
		what I learn along the way.
